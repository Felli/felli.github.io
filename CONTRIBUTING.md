## Pulls & Issues
Please before opening a pull or an issue search through the projects' pulls/issues before creating one of your own, this make it easier for me.

## Requirements
1. All pulls & issues must be listed `Enh:`, `Bugfix:`, `Q:`, or `Bug:` before I'll take them seriously.
2. You should double check then double check your pull/issue before making them to make sure you didn't miss anything useful.
3. Be as detailed as possible! (Screenshot, Video, & etc.)
4. Be patient I'm only one person and I can't get to everything at one time.
